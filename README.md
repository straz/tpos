### Show the real-time position of the T
**Boston MBTA - public transportation**

This app is all client-side javascript, there is no server code other than
Google Maps (for the Javascript Maps API) and the MBTA (for the realtime data feed).


## Demo
Visit [http://tpos.us](http://tpos.us)

note: The map centers on your location, and shows you the real-time position of
Boston subway trains, so it works better if you're in or near downtown Boston
when you run the app.
